Inventory ??
A inventory define a collection of hosts that ansible will manage. These host cann assigned to group. group can contain child group, and hosts can be members of multiple group.

There are two types of inventory- static and dynamic

Building an inventory-
default location - /etc/ansible/hosts

To managed host in better way , create directory as the name of project and create ansible.cfg, hosts for seprate projects.

like mkdir project1 and then touch ansible.cfg hosts.
mkdir project2 and then touch ansible.cfg hosts.

$ ansible --list-host all -i <custom inventory location>
$ ansible --list-host  production


command to check hosts in inventory
$ ansible --list-hosts all

Before doing the any task , first we create one local user to all managed host with sudo permission and nopasswd
$ sudo useradd techuser
$ Sudo vim /etc/sudoers and add techuser ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD:ALL

create ssh key on control node and copy to all managed host to connect keybased authentication.
$ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ec2-user@<Instance_B_IP>
