INCREASE EBS ROOT VOLUME OF EC2
We can easily increase root volume of ebs on AWS .
1)First login on AWS Account and Search EC2.

 
2) Select instance and click on storage 
 
 
3) Take backup of volume before modify for safer side
Select volume and go to action and then click on snapshot
 
4)Select Volume and go to modify volume under Action button 

 
 
5) Changed required volume size and click on modify.
 
6)Wait until optimizing 100% and in-use status 
 
7) Connect ec2 using putty or terminal or power shell
and run command - 
# lsblk
 
8) We can check modification is show on above screenshot but not mounted, Run next command
#sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
#lsbk
 
9) check file system of exiting volume using this command
# file -s /dev/xvd*
 10) In our case XFS file system is here. run command
# xfs_growfs -d /
 If you were using an ext4 (or even older ext2 or ext3) file system, you could extend it using the “resize2fs /dev/xvda1” command.
