Here we do adding a agent node to master jenkins.(Both are on AWS)

We have created two instace master and agent.
After that we install java and jenkins on master node. configure as well.
On agent node , we install java.

For adding to agent node. First we go to master node and run below command.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key.pub ubuntu@agent_instance_ip
create the new key and copy to agent server. if copy not working manually cat public key and add to authorized key of agent.

then we going to manage jenkins section then click on node. then click on add node.

here we fill agent name, description, remote directory root, like below-
Node Name: agent-node-1
Remote Root Directory: /home/ubuntu/jenkins
Labels: linux
Usage: Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node
Launch Method: Launch agents via SSH
Host: your-agent-node-ip
Credentials:
Kind: SSH Username with private key
Username: ubuntu
Private Key: Enter directly or use the private key file.




if you get error like this- error- /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts [SSH] No Known Hosts file was found at /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts. Please ensure one is created at this path and that Jenkins can read it.
Key exchange was not finished, connection is closed. then run the below command on master node.
sudo su - jenkins
mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
chmod 700 /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
ssh-keyscan -H agent_instance_ip >> /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
chmod 644 /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
