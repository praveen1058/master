SHELL SCRIPT, CRONTAB, USER MANAGEMENT

SHELL SCRIPT

A shell script is a list of commands in a computer program that is run by the Unix shell which is a command line interpreter.

CRONTAB

Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended. A command called crontab allows the user to submit, edit or delete entries to cron. A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information.

USER MANAGEMENT

A user is an entity, in a Linux operating system, that can manipulate files and perform several other operations. Each user is assigned an ID that is unique for each user in the operating system.



Here, We will create some script using loop to create some files and directories. As a DevOps Engineer, we create this type of task.


Example-

1. Creates some files using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or arguments.

#!/bin/bash
for n in {1..5};
do
    mkdir movie$n
done

2. Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.

* * * * * tar -zcf /home/dev/script.tgz /home/dev/script
